How to install xDrip+ Prerequisites Which one to install ? Install xDrip+ Select your data source What is xDrip+? xDrip+ is an unofficial and independent Android app which works as data hub and processor between many different devices. It supports wireless connections to G4, G5, G6, Medtrum A6, Libre via NFC and Bluetooth, 630G, 640G, 670G pumps and Eversense CGM via companion apps. Bluetooth Glucose Meters such as the Contour Next One, AccuChek Guide, Verio Flex & Diamond Mini as well as devices like the Pendiq 2.0 Insulin Pen. Heart-rate and step counter data is processed from Android Wear, Garmin, Fitbit and Pebble smart-watches and watch-faces for those that show glucose values and graphs. On some Android Wear watches, it is possible for the G5 or G6 to talk directly to the watch so it can display values even when out of range of the phone. The app contains sophisticated charting, customization and data entry features as well as a predictive simulation model. Instant two-way synchronization is possible by linking follower handsets, data can also be uploaded and downloaded to a Nightscout web service or uploaded directly to Tidepool, MongoDB or InfluxDB. Customization allows for different options to configure alarms, vocalize readings, change the display preferences etc. International users can update translations from within the app too. Your data is yours and can be exported in many different ways. xDrip also intercommunicates with other apps, for example sending and receiving live data with AndroidAPS. History DexDrip was created by Emma Black in 2014 and then became xDrip , an app collecting CGM data from a Dexcom G4 receiver or a bridge device and sending them to Nightscout . It also came with the follower app Nightwatch . This project was then modified by @jamorham to become xDrip+ . Personal research version of xDrip xDrip+ is published by the Nightscout Foundation.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-xdrip-documentation","text":"What is xDrip+ ?","title":"Welcome to the xDrip+ documentation"},{"location":"#how-to-install-xdrip","text":"Prerequisites Which one to install ?

Minimum supported Android version is 4.4 but 6 and above is recommended. If you will connect xDrip+ to a sensor your phone must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): you can use utilities like this one to check. In order to connect to a Bluetooth CGM your phone needs to have location enabled (GPS). If you want to use the embedded master - follower function of xDrip+ (called xDrip+ Sync) your phone needs to have the Google Play Services installed. If you wish to use scanning features for Libre sensors your phone needs an NFC reader. If using Android 10 and above make sure you use a recent version of xDrip+ (see below). Which one to install? xDrip+ is not available in the Google Play store by developers decision. You will find all releases in Github . If you don't know which one to select you have two choices: Latest release Latest release is a stable version of xDrip+. It doesn't have all the newest features but has proven stability and doesn't suffer severe bugs. It's a safe version to start with. You can download it here . Pre-release Pre-release include most recent xDrip+ developments like translations, new features and bug fixes. And it might also contain some bugs... Still, it is the version you want to use to benefit most recent improvements. All xDrip+ versions are available here . Expand the assets and select the .apk file. You will find it in your phone Downloads directory. Note: don't use Facebook links to download xDrip+ but copy and paste the link into a browser (like Chrome). Note: Private versions Some developers add features and customizations that are not available in the official pre-releases until the author will create a Pull Request in xDrip+ and get it merged in the main project. You can use these versions but need to understand they might be supported only by their creator. xDrip+ automatic updates won't work with private versions. Install xDrip+ Once downloaded, install the xDrip+ apk. You need to authorize installation of apps from unknown sources in Android security settings. xDrip+ is virus and malware free: being open source and controlled by the main developer make its distribution safe if you download it from GitHub.

Authorize background activity xDrip+ must have the right to run in background: it must be whitelisted to battery optimization. This is essential to a correct functioning. It should ask you to allow this authorization. If it doesn't or you need to verify this later, you'll have to check it in your phone Settings - Apps - xDrip+ . Consult your phone manual as it will depend on Android version and manufacturer. Select your data source If you want to connect xDrip+ directly to your sensor, select it in the wizard. If you don't see the wizard you can start it using the START SOURCE SETUP WIZARD button on the main screen. If you don't see this button you can bring it back to display with a long press on the xDrip+ icon blood drop and enable source wizard button. Dexcom In order to connect xDrip+ to a Dexcom G5 or G6 sensor you need to uninstall the Dexcom app from this phone or any other phone connected to it. The Dexcom receiver will continue to receive the sensor signal as it's using another Bluetooth channel. Note that xDrip+ will allow the use of Dexcom Share servers but will not upload data to Clarity . If you decide to use this solution, it is recommended to use Tidepool or Nightscout to generate your reports. If you want to use xDrip+ but you still want to connect your sensor to the Dexcom app, go back to the first page and select Other. You can use xDrip+ either as a Dexcom Share follower (but you will need network access) or build your own Dexcom app (enabling broadcast to xDrip+) and select 640G/670G or Eversense as the data source. Else continue here: Dexcom G4 Dexcom G5 Dexcom G6 Freestyle Libre You can use xDrip+ to scan your Libre ( Not 14 days US version) sensor selecting the any of these data sources if your phone has an NFC reader. Note that there is only limited value in doing so as the only advantage is to be able to calibrate the readings. In order to get the best of xDrip+ it is recommended that you buy an additional bridge device doing the sensor scan automatically every 5 minutes. Continue here: Bridge devices like LimiTTer (obsolete), blueReader (obsolete), Blucon, miaomiao (Tomato), Bubble or Droplet LibreAlarm: Patched Sony SWR50 Patched app (Libre 2 not US version) Libre 2 ( not US version) Others 640G/670G with the Medtronic uploader app and the BYO Dexcom app .
