# LibreAlarm

The Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50) was one of the very few smartwatches able to read the Libre sensor with its internal NFC reader, and gave birth to [early projects as a bridge](https://github.com/jamorham/LibreAlarm/releases). This is now an archived project, some guidelines still available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/67jmkj/my_hombrew_android_cgm_build_so_far_sony/).

xDrip+ supports this feature with the data source LibreAlarm.

For this to work you need to [patch the watch to enable the NFC reader](https://github.com/pimpimmi/LibreAlarm/wiki).

You will then need to install the xDrip+ watchface on the watch.
