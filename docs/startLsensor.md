# Start sensor

xDrip+ is not able to start a Libre sensor, neither is it to stop one (actually nothing can stop a sensor: if it doesn't fail it will run it's useful lifetime and stop by itself after 14 days and 12 hours).

xDrip+ sensor start is only used to track lifetime and make sure calibrations are updated. This operation is necessary and recommended each time you replace your sensor.
